# AppImageBuilder
## Overview
This Bash script automates the process of using an AppImage on a Linux system. It takes an AppImage file as an argument, makes it executable, creates a desktop shortcut for the application, and updates the GTK libraries if needed.

## Prerequisites
- Linux Operating System
- Bash (Bourne Again SHell)

## Usage
1. Ensure the script has executable permissions:
```bash
chmod +x AppImageBuilder.sh
```

2. Run the script with the AppImage file as an argument:
```bash
./AppImageBuilder.sh <appimage file path>
```
Replace **`<appimage file>`** with the path to the AppImage file you want to use.

3. The script will perform the following steps:
    - Check if the AppImage file exists.
    - Update the GTK libraries (if applicable) using package managers like `apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`, or `pacman`.
    - Make the AppImage file executable.
    - Create a desktop shortcut file (.desktop) for the application on the user's desktop.
    - Grant execute permission to the desktop shortcut file.
    - Execute the application.

### Note
- The script may require administrator privileges (sudo) to update GTK libraries. You may be prompted to enter your password during execution.

- If the application already has an existing .desktop file with the same name on the user's desktop, it will be overwritten.

- The script assumes that the AppImage file and the script (AppImageBuilder.sh) are in the same directory. Ensure they are in the same location before executing the script.

- The script uses default package managers for common Linux distributions (apt-get for Debian/Ubuntu, dnf for Fedora, yum for CentOS/RHEL, and pacman for Arch). If your distribution uses a different package manager, modify the script accordingly.

- The script attempts to update GTK libraries to resolve potential graphical issues. If the application works fine without updating GTK, you can remove or modify the related section of the script.
